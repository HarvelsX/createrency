âœ¨ This is a Create-based tech modpack that combines [Sugar](https://github.com/HarvelsX/Sugar) and [Create](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create) with add-ons and integrations.

ðŸª„ With Sugar, this modpack gives you great performance on different configurations of personal computers, while allowing you to keep all the things you are so used to: _CTM_, _CIT_, _Capes_, _CEM_, _Zoom_ and etc from **Optifine**.

ðŸŽ‰ And all this is already available and ready to play, you only need to install modpack and enjoy your gameplay!

Thank you ðŸ’– for being there and have a nice game!
